Hey, i saw you posted about helping on the CSS of the sub, nbaspurs. We've been meaning to automate a few things, and by doing so, adding some new stuff that just updates itself like ppg and all that. The issue is, the current active mods aren't (me included) aren't familiar with CSS enough to do this.

My question is, do you know how to automate this kind of stuff? What else can you do on CSS? What do you think

Well, to be honest, i'm quite familiar with CSS but i don't know much about automating css, i have a couple of ideas though. I bet i can figure it out if you give me some time and a copy of the CSS and the sidebar.
If you're interested i can give it a shot, i actually enjoy doing this kinds of stuff so it's no trouble for me.

Is the sidebar schedule automated?

The sidebar schedule is not automated, at the moment, nothing is. Also, the sidebar doe not appear in the CSS, at least not to my knowledge. I've had 0 experience with CSS, but figured out enough to do the flairs recently. I've been stuck at that point thus far.

One guy told me that to automate things, you basically need to write a python script for it, but I got nowhere with that as well.

Anyways, for future reference, here is the CSS code: http://www95.zippyshare.com/v/3rHvoxnR/file.html

let me know what you discover, I can be handy (did a few programming classes in uni)

I'm more interested in the sidebar, i found a thread that says it can be found at /r/nba/about/edit . But it's not working for me, maybe because i'm not a mod. Could you check if you can see it? There has to be a place where you mods edit the sidebar.

ya well, first thats the one for r/nba, second, you arent a mod so u wont be able to see it. Anyways that piece of text, i dont know if its CSS or not, but it looks different from the stylesheet. You wont learn much from it. Here it is:

Ohhh, all right all right. I think i understand how it's done now. The guy that told you about the script was right.
We need to write a script that scrapes data from stats.nba.com or wherever the ppg stats are and generate a text like the one you just shared with me. Then you mods would just copy it and paste it wherever it is that you edit the sidebar.

I actually already know how to scrape the data, i'll just need to format it and set up a site where you can get if from.

I'll try to get it done in the next few days. I'll let you know if i made any progress.

Hey, i did a quick script that gets PTS, REB, AST, STL and BLK from the whole roster and formats it into a reddit table.
You can run it in from this link.

You mods can just copy&paste it and it'll look like this:

Team Stats

Player	PTS	REB	AST	STL	BLK
Boban Marjanovic	5.1	3	0.3	0.3	0.6
Boris Diaw	7.2	3.4	2.5	0.4	0.2
Danny Green	7	3.6	1.9	0.8	0.7
David West	6.4	3.9	1.7	0.6	0.6
Jonathon Simmons	5.7	1.6	1.2	0.4	0.1
Kawhi Leonard	20.2	7	2.6	2	0.9
Kyle Anderson	3.4	2.2	1	0.4	0.4
LaMarcus Aldridge	16.2	9.1	1.3	0.4	0.9
Manu Ginobili	10.4	3	3.6	1	0.1
Matt Bonner	2	0.9	0.2	0.2	0
Patty Mills	7.7	1.8	2.5	0.9	0.1
Rasual Butler	2.4	1.2	0.5	0.3	0.5
Ray McCallum	2.2	1	1.3	0.3	0.2
Tim Duncan	9.2	7.8	3	0.9	1.3
Tony Parker	12.8	2.5	5.2	0.8	0.2
And if you paste it on the sidebar it'll take the sub CSS and look exactly like the schedule table.

Let me know if it worked and if you would like any changes, its no problem at all.
I can can change it to any other stats, remove players, order or anything.

looks really good buddy, good work! I sent it to the other mods to take a look and see what they think. Now, I just have to figure out how to automate that stuff, like posting the schedule/record/stats and posting the pregame/postgame threads up. If you have any advice or help, i'd greatly appreciate it!

You can check out the code here in case any of you know programming and want to make any changes.

what language is this? I know C, C#, and Java :D

Permalink
[–]from jorgegil96 sent 2 years ago
PHP, but if you know any language you can pick it put quickly, just read about the syntax and about JSON files, i'm reading the data from here http://stats.nba.com/stats/playerprofilev2?playerID=1495&PerMode=PerGame for each player.

Hey, quick update. I decided to switch to Python because it's the best language to built reddit bots, which is the next step after finishing the sidebar maker.
So here's the new link to the code, it now generates the whole sidebar, with the record and the stats automated (working on the schedule rn).
After i finish with the schedule the next step would be making a bot that automatically updates the sidebar and creates game threads. That is done using PRAW, a Python Reddit API wrapper.

I'll probably won't continue until friday, but i'll let you know.

PS: If you want to run the python file, you have to install python then save the file (the script) anywhere on your pc, navigate to it from the command line and run "python sidebar.py".

Hey, i just finished the script.

Record, schedule and stats are retrieved automatically and uploaded to the sub's sidebar.

I made a subreddit to test it out (/r/autospurs) and it's working great so far. Here's the code.

In order for the script to run, it needs the username and password of a moderator (as seen in the last lines of the script).

It is not fully automatic because you still have to run it everytime you want to update the sidebar, it just makes it a hell of a lot more easier. To make it fully automatic we'd need a hosting service or a PC that is on at all times and runs it every X hours or so. I figured it's not worth the cost and trouble, you just need to enter:

python sidebar.py    
into the command line and that's it. I bet the mods do a lot more work than that every day.

So to run it on /r/nbaspurs you have 3 options:
1. Download the script and run it yourself. You will have to install Python 3.5 and PRAW. (I can give you more details on how to do it if you want)
2. Give me the username and password of an account that is moderator of /r/nbaspurs and i'll run it (You can make a new one just for that).
3. Make me a mod and i'll run it with my account.

I'll keep making tiny tweaks to it and keep testing it on /r/autospurs to see if any errors come up.

that is great!!! Great work!! I havn't tried it out myself yet, but damn this helps for sure! Could you send this exact message to /r/nbaspurs so all the mods see it? Personally, I'd like to add you as a mod, you've helped a lot and you have CSS skills, which we need now! ill go about trying it out myself right now, see how it works!
